# solar_flare

#### Notes:
1. add to readme
2. renan, need a step0 script for reading the json files to create `fold{1..4}_all.tsv`
3. clean code and check that it works after cleaned
4. add a reading list?
5. plotting and analysis scripts
6. Rmarkdown readme with simple examples of function (we don't want to be discriminated because we are R users)
